# School-Data-Analysis-Pandas
School District Analysis using Pandas DataFrame


## Introduction
This project involves analyzing school and standardized test data for a city's school district. The goal is to aggregate and analyze the data to identify trends in school performance. The analysis covers various aspects, including district-level and school-level summaries, as well as breakdowns based on spending, school size, and school type.

## Files and Structure
- `School-Data-Analysis-Pandas/`
  - `School-Data-Analysis-Pandas.py`: The analysis script.
  - `School-Data-Analysis_jupyter_Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook script
  - `Resources/`
    - `schools_complete.csv`: CSV file containing school data.
    - `students_complete.csv`: CSV file containing student data.

## Analysis Summary
The analysis includes the following sections:

1. **District Summary**: Calculates and presents key metrics for the entire district.
2. **School Summary**: Summarizes key metrics for each individual school.
3. **Top-Performing Schools**: Lists the top-performing schools based on overall passing percentage. Cabrera High School is the Top_performing school 
4. **Lowest-Performing Schools**: Ford High School is the lowest-performing school

## Observations and Conclusions
1. **School Type Impact**: Charter schools generally outperform district schools in terms of average scores and passing percentages. This trend is consistent across both math and reading subjects.

2. **Spending vs. Performance**: Schools with lower per-student spending tend to have higher passing percentages in both math and reading. This suggests that increased spending does not always correlate with improved performance.

Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into school performance based on various factors, which can aid decision-making for the school district's future budget allocation and priorities.
